ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting continuous values.
It covers dataset preprocessing, feature encoding, and building an SVR model for regression tasks.

ðŸ§° Features

Data loading and preprocessing

Feature encoding for categorical variables

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/Support_vector_practice.git

Navigate to project folder:
cd Support_vector_practice

Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook supportvector.ipynb

ðŸ“Š Results
The SVR model is trained and evaluated on the dataset.
Predictions are compared with actual values.
Performance metrics highlight how well SVR captures the regression patterns.

ðŸ”® Future Work

Experiment with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF).
Apply hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
Test on larger datasets.
